# Assessment Summary
# This is an exceptional infrastructure deployment that demonstrates expert-level
# containerized architecture knowledge. The implementation exceeds typical standards
# with sophisticated monitoring, backup strategies, and high availability configurations.
# The single MEDIUM concern about Kong version currency is easily addressable and
# should not block the deployment process significantly.
